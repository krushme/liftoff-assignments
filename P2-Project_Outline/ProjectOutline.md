[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

### Overview
The garden planner will be used to identify potential
seeds and plants that a user might use to get a garden started.
For a gardener/user who would wish to plant a garden the
garden planner will provide information as far as which seeds to
plant during a certain season winter, spring, summer, and fall.
The app will provide gardening information needed to maintain
the plants. It may also provide space relation to how many
plants can be grown within a certain amount of area.

The user might find the app information provided useful to plan
and maintain a garden. The user will find the information that is
provided will come from different API's and this will allow the
